Hello my name is Ignacio Bala. I am a front-end programmer and soon full stack.
I am currently studying a technical degree in Programming and, in turn, I take courses at "the house of the future" in Mendoza.

I want to expand my knowledge, and I am looking for a company that can give me the same.

I am a good collaborator and I like to work in a team.

I hope you can contact me!
